Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

Types of Machine Learning

There are three main types of machine learning:

1. Supervised Learning
Supervised learning algorithms learn from labeled training data. The algorithm learns to map input data to known outputs. Common examples include classification and regression problems.

2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The algorithm tries to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data. Clustering is a common example.

3. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. The agent learns to achieve a goal through trial and error.

Applications

Machine learning has many applications including:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Medical diagnosis

Conclusion

Machine learning continues to advance rapidly, enabling new capabilities across many domains.
