In the context of Information Systems, Generative Artificial Intelligence is reshaping how organizations create, manage, and utilize knowledge. 
Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT enable new forms of human-computer interaction by generating coherent text, summaries, and insights from complex data. 
Beyond automation, these models serve as cognitive tools that augment human decision-making. 
However, their integration into enterprise systems requires careful consideration of data governance, ethical constraints, and transparency. 
The strategic use of GenAI in Information Systems aligns technology capabilities with organizational learning and innovation.
