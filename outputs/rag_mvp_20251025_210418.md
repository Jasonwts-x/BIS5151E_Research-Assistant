Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is reshaping how organizations create, manage, and utilize knowledge in Information Systems [1]. Large Language Models like GPT enable new forms of human-computer interaction by generating coherent text, summaries, and insights from complex data. Beyond automation, these models serve as cognitive tools that augment human decision-making. The strategic use of GenAI in Information Systems aligns technology capabilities with organizational learning and innovation [1].

In the context of digital transformation, it is crucial to consider not only technology adoption but also cultural change, leadership commitment, and continuous innovation [2]. Key enablers include cloud computing, data analytics, artificial intelligence, and automation.
