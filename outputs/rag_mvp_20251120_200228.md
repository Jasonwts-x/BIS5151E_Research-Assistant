Here is a concise overview of the key ideas across the provided documents:

Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in Information Systems [1] is reshaping how organizations create, manage, and utilize knowledge. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT enable new forms of human-computer interaction by generating coherent text, summaries, and insights from complex data. GenAI serves as cognitive tools that augment human decision-making, but its integration into enterprise systems requires careful consideration of data governance, ethical constraints, and transparency [1]. Digital transformation [2] refers to the integration of digital technologies into all areas of a business, which fundamentally changes how organizations operate and deliver value to customers. Successful transformation requires not only technology adoption but also cultural change, leadership commitment, and continuous innovation [2]. The application of GenAI in academic workflows is explored through ResearchAssistantGPT [3], a prototype that demonstrates the potential of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines in supporting literature review, citation management, and automated summarization.
